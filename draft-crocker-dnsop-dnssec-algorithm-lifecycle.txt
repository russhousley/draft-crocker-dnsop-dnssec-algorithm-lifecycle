          Documenting and Managing DNSSEC Algorithm Lifecycles
         draft-crocker-dnsop-dnssec-algorithm-lifecycle-latest

Abstract

   Cryptographic algorithms for DNSSEC go through multiple phases during
   their lifetime.  They are created, tested, adopted, used, and
   deprecated over a period of time.  This RFC defines phases for the
   DNSSEC algorithm lifecycle, and it defines the criteria for moving
   from one phase to the next.

1.  Background

   Each DNSSEC cryptographic algorithm is used in two distinct but
   interconnected ways.  The first is to sign.  The second is to
   validate a signature.  If someone uses an algorithm to sign, the
   party that receives that signed message should be able to validate
   the signature.  This means the receiving parties need to implement
   the validation algorithm before the sending parties can expect to use
   it effectively.  Equally, the receiving parties have to keep the
   validation algorithm in service even after the signing parties stop
   using it.

   These relationships seem obvious, but there has not been an organized
   way to communicate within the Internet community regarding these
   algorithm transitions.  This document builds upon the enhancements
   defined in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-rfc8624-bis] to the IANA "DNS Security
   Algorithm Numbers" registry [DNSKEY-IANA] and the IANA "DNSSEC
   Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Record (RR) Type Digest Algorithms"
   registry [DS-IANA]; the values in these registries tell the phase
   that the algorithm is in with respect to this lifecycle.  This
   document discusses both the expected phasing in and out of algorithms
   individually using these IANA registries, as well the need for how
   the DNSSEC ecosystem as a whole should ensure it is left in a
   resilient cryptographic state.

2.  Seven phases in the lifecycle of a DNSSEC algorithm

   We define seven phases in the lifecycle of an individual DNSSEC
   algorithm.

   1.  Experimental: The algorithm is under development by the
       cryptographic community and is not yet ready for general use.

   2.  Adopted: The algorithm is ready to be used by the Internet
       community.  It is listed in the IANA registry.  Implementers are
       expected to support the algorithm for signature validation.

   3.  Available: The algorithm is ready for use by all parties.
       Implementers are expected to support the algorithm for signing
       and signature validation.

   4.  Mainstream: The algorithm has reached "recommended" status.
       Implementers are expected to support the algorithm for signing
       and signature validation.

   5.  Phaseout: The algorithm is nearing the end of its lifecycle, but
       it is still in use.  Implementers are advised to transition to
       other recommended algorithms.  Signing should be phased out.

   6.  Deprecated: All use for signing should have stopped, but
       signature validation is still supported.

   7.  Obsolete: No support for signing or signature validation is
       expected.

3.  Process and Criteria for transitions

   The previous section does not specify the process and criteria for
   advancing a DNSSEC algorithm through these lifecycle phases.  There
   are six transition points, labelled A through F, between these seven
   lifecycle phases.  We propose the following process and criteria for
   these transitions.

   A.  Algorithm Inclusion

   *  Prerequisites:

      -  Algorithm has been given a Mnemonic and number in the "DNS
         Security Algorithm Numbers" registry.

      -  Cryptographic community has determined that the algorithm as
         suitable to use for DNSSEC.

      -  Documentation and implementations are widely available and
         stable.

   *  IETF determines the algorithm is suitable for use with DNSSEC.

   *  Action: IETF publishes notice that the algorithm is suitable for
      use and should be deployed for signature validation.

   B.  Ready for Use

   *  Prerequisites:

      -  Deployment has been measured.

      -  Deployment is deemed to have reached an acceptable level.

   *  IETF reaches consensus that algorithm has been widely deployed for
      DNSSEC.

   *  Action: IETF publishes notice that algorithm is available for
      DNSSEC signing.

   C.  Mainstream

   *  IETF reaches consensus that algorithm has reached mainstream
      status; deployment is essentially universal.

   *  Actions:

      -  IETF publishes notice that algorithm has reached mainstream
         status.

      -  Signers using older algorithms, particularly algorithms in the
         Phaseout or later phases should transition to a mainstream
         algorithm.

   D.  Phaseout

   *  Prerequisites:

      -  Cryptographic community has determined the algorithm is
         reaching its end of life.

   *  IETF determines it is time to announce the phaseout.

   *  Action: IETF publishes notice to signing operators to transition
      away from the algorithm and begin signing with a mainstream
      algorithm.

   E.  Deprecation

   *  Prerequisites:

      -  Measure signing activity.

      -  Signing activity is deemed to have largely subsided.

   *  IETF determines it is time to deprecate the algorithm for use with
      DNSSEC.

   *  Action: IETF publishes notice that use of the algorithm is now
      inappropriate for DNSSEC signing.

   F.  Obsolescence

   *  Prerequisite: Measurement of signing is at the lowest achievable
      level.

   *  IETF determines the algorithm is obsolete.

   *  Action: IETF publishes notice that algorithm is obsolete and ought
      be removed from implementations.

4.  Lifecycle Phase and the IANA Registry

   The enhancements to the IANA registry of DNSSEC algorithms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-rfc8624-bis].  Table 1 suggests the values to be
   placed into each of the IANA registry columns "Use for DNSSSEC
   Signing", "Use for DNSSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSSEC
   Signing", and "Implement for DNSSSEC Validation" for each phase in
   the algorithms lifecycle defined in Section 2.  The IETF is
   encouraged to follow Table 1 when assigning the values in both of
   these IANA registries algorithms as each algorithm progresses through
   the lifecycle.

5.  Considerations for maintaining a robust DNSSEC algorithm state

   The above considers the values associated with a particular algorithm
   in the IANA registry for "DNS Security Algorithm Numbers"
   [DNSKEY-IANA] and the IANA registry for "DNSSEC Delegation Signer
   (DS) Resource Record (RR) Type Digest Algorithms" [DS-IANA].  It is
   equally as important to ensure that as algorithms come into favor and
   out of favor that the current set of available algorithms always
   include some that are the Mainstream state.  As the IETF community
   considers transitioning a particular algorithm beyond the Mainstream
   state, it must simultaneously ensure that at least one other
   algorithm is already present in the Mainstream state or that one
   other algorithm is in the Ready to Use state and available to become
   a Mainstream algorithm.  Specifically, at no time should there be
   zero algorithms in the Mainstream state.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to amend the [DNSKEY-IANA] and [DS-IANA] registries to
   show the current phase of each algorithm.  In addition, IANA is asked
   to show the history of future transitions through each phase.

   The IESG is asked to name a panel of at least three designated
   experts (see Section 5 of [RFC8126]) to advise IANA when an algorithm
   is under consideration to be moved from one phase to the next.  These
   designated experts should be familiar with hash functions, digital
   signature algorithms, and the DSNSEC protocol.

   IANA has no actions related to this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document proposes a lifecycle for DNSSEC algorithms.  By
   following the criteria presented in Section 3, Internet-wide
   deployment of new DNSSEC algorithm will occur in a smooth manner that
   ensures all implementations will be able to validate signatures.
   Likewise, following the criteria will ensure that out-of-date DNSSEC
   algorithm are retired in a graceful manner.  The criteria associated
   with the transition between phases of the lifecycle will depend on
   the process that makes changes to the IANA registry as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-rfc8624-bis].

   If the industry fails to achieve global consensus on the state of any
   one algorithm such that domain owners deploying signing zones
   disagree with the deployed validating resolvers then it likely that
   DNS resolutions will fail, rendering the DNS unusable.  As such,
   vendors of both authoritative and recursive resolvers, and the
   operating systems that deploy them, are encouraged to strictly follow
   the current guidance to avoid DNS interoperability issues.
